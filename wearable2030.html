          <h1>Wearable 2030</h1>
          <h5><a href="blog.html">日本語で読む</a></h5>

            Wearables can help physical advancement for atheles to perkinson
            disease patient. More Apple Watch apps which supports 3D motions
            will come in coming years. But the buttery is one of the big issues
            in the werables.

            At Northeastern. a few electrical engineering and mechanical
            engineering kids were writting about the maintenance-free power
            sources, Thermoelectric. This effect allows the power generation
            from the heat. Material scientists are still trying to improve the
            efficiency of Thermoelectric electrical generator. Another issue
            with TEGs is their rigidity and bulkiness, which prevents them from
            being practical. Mechatronics is an intresting field for
            Thermoelectric and werables.
            <a href="https://www.matrixindustries.com/">MATRIX Industries</a> is
            one of the smart watch example which doesnt need a charger. There
            are more ways of save battery and charge. One of which is swapping.
            We use to give sentimentL values to electrical goods. But we dont as
            much any more. As our software doest store data locally as much, the
            concept of swapping can be a method for smart phones and wearables.
            There are more than 300 EV company in China, one of the leader, NIO,
            Aulton & Geely. As of today, there are more than 500 swaping
            stations. stations

            Near Firld Communications(NFC) are what you find inside Apple Pay,
            metropolitan metro cards. 20 cents per a tag. Tag can hold mini
            infomations and transmit to the reciver. If you wanted, you dont
            need a apple watch and you can stick a NFC tage in Rolex Deepsea and
            use it as a metro card. shapes and concept of wearble are changing
            everyday. I want to intergrade NFC into my app to make business card
            app. But it is so hard and please contact me if you know how-to or
            know someone who knows it.
