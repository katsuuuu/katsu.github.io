          <h1>Wearable 2030</h1>
          <!-- <h5><a href="wearable2030jp.html">日本語で読む</a></h5> -->
          <p>
            Wearables can help physical advancement for athletes, and
            Parkinson's disease patients, etc. More Apple Watch apps that
            support 3D motions will come in coming years, and we can get the
            pattern data of all kinds of movements. But the battery is one of
            the significant issues in the wearables.

            At Northeastern. a few electrical engineering and mechanical
            engineering kids were writing about the maintenance-free power
            sources, Thermoelectric. This electronic generator allows power
            generation from the heat. The cool idea is to generate power from
            the heat on humans. Your wrist is warmer when you wear a watch,
            right? But material scientists are still trying to improve the
            efficiency of Thermoelectric electrical generators. Another issue
            with Thermoelectric is their rigidity and bulkiness, which prevents
            them from being practical. Mechatronics is an exciting field for
            Thermoelectric and wearables. If anyone has good online learning
            material, lmk. Mechatronics is like an interaction of computer
            science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. MATRIX
            Industries is one of the smartwatch examples which doesn't need a
            charger. There are more ways of saving battery and charge. One of
            which is battery swapping. We used to hold more sentimental value to
            electrical products. But we don't do as much anymore. As our
            software doesn't stores data locally as much, the concept of
            swapping can be a method for smartphones and wearables. There are
            more than 300 EV companies in China, one of the leaders, NIO, Aulton
            & Geely uses the technique of battery swapping. As of today, NIO
            operates more than 500 swapping stations. Our wearables's battery or
            the device itself could also be swaped in coming years or be rented
            out for a temporary use.

            Near Field Communications(NFC) are what you find inside Apple Pay
            and metropolitan metro cards. 20 cents per tag. A tag can hold mini
            information and transmit it to the receiver. If you want, you don't
            need an Apple watch to use your card, and you can stick a NFC tag in
            the back of Rolex Deepsea and use it as a metro card. Shapes and
            concepts of wearable are changing every day. I want to intergrade
            NFC into my app to make a business card app or app alternative to
            USB. But it is so complex, and please contact me if you know how-to
            or know someone who knows it.

            Another change is the material of wearables. Bluetooth Low Energy
            allowed the mass production of inexpensive wearables. But there are
            so many plastics. Some companies are shifting to Biodegradable
            wearables. <br />
            Lastly, werables will be not so werable as we start to insert
            devices inside our body. we advanced to insert needles and plates to
            fix our bones and bodies. Pace maker was developed in 50s. I see it
            as an exciting tool to gain superpower.
